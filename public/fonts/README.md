# Font Setup Instructions

## Feast of Flesh BB Font

To use the "Feast of Flesh BB" font in this project:

1. Download the font from [Font Zillion](https://www.fontzillion.com/fonts/blambot/feast-of-flesh-bb) or another font provider
2. Place the font files in this directory (`public/fonts/`) with the following names:
   - `FeastOfFleshBB.woff2` (preferred format)
   - `FeastOfFleshBB.woff` (fallback)
   - `FeastOfFleshBB.ttf` (fallback)

3. The font is already configured in `src/index.css` and will automatically be used throughout the site.

**Note:** If you don't have the font files, the site will fall back to Impact, Arial Black, or other bold sans-serif fonts, which will still provide an aggressive, bold look.
